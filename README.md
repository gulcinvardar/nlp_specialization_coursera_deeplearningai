4. [With Attention Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/attention-models-in-nlp#syllabus):
+ Neural Machine Translation
+ Text Summarization
+ Question Answering
+ Chatbot

### Content of the folders:
For modules 1-3, you find all the exercises and the assignments with my solutions. Because of the big file sizes, I worked on the attention model assignments online. I only downloaded the files without the solutions to keep them as a template for potential future NLP projects.

Here is my certificate :)
